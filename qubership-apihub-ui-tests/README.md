# APIHUB UI auto-tests (Playwright)

Playwright-based test project for APIHUB UI:

- Portal UI end-to-end tests (`--project=Portal`)
- ADV smoke-style checks (`ADV-operations`, `ADV-comparisons`)
- Cleanup project (`--project=Cleanup`)

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Playwright system deps: see [Playwright system requirements](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#system-requirements)
- Node.js + npm

### Install

```Shell
npm ci
```

```Shell
npx playwright install
```

### Configure environment

`.env` is supported (recommended for local runs).

Minimum required variables:

- `BASE_URL`
- `TEST_USER_PASSWORD`

### Run Portal end-to-end tests

```Shell
npx playwright test --project=Portal
```

## Documentation map (project-local)

### Engineering guidelines

- [docs/CODING_GUIDELINES.md](docs/CODING_GUIDELINES.md) — canonical conventions (test structure, assertions, TDM, POM, locator strategy)
- [docs/pom-in-practice.md](docs/pom-in-practice.md) — real POM patterns + examples
- [docs/localhost-run.md](docs/localhost-run.md) — localhost/proxy specifics
- [docs/custom-reporter.md](docs/custom-reporter.md) — custom Playwright reporter (summary HTML, GitHub Step Summary, CI status)

The project uses **ESLint** for code quality and style.

### AI Agents

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — mandatory workflow for AI agents
- [docs/ai-instructions/](docs/ai-instructions/) — task playbooks and guides

### Suite artifacts colocated with tests

Keep suite artifacts (feature overview / POM instructions / test plan) next to the tests.

- If a suite has a single spec file, keep artifacts in the same folder as the spec.
- If a suite has multiple spec files, group them in a dedicated folder and keep artifacts in that folder too.

Example (API Quality suite folder):

- [src/tests/portal/00-serial/15-api-quality/](src/tests/portal/00-serial/15-api-quality/)

## Running tests

### Common commands

```Shell
npx playwright test --project=Portal
```

```Shell
npx playwright test --project=Portal --last-failed
```

```Shell
npx playwright test --project=Portal --headed --trace=on
```

### HTML report

```Shell
npx playwright show-report reports/playwright
```

### Custom summary report

`CustomReporter` writes `reports/summary/status` (CI gate) and, for non-unit runs, `reports/summary/summary-report.html`. In GitHub Actions it also appends a Markdown summary to the job page.

See [docs/custom-reporter.md](docs/custom-reporter.md) for configuration and behavior.

More options:

- [Playwright test CLI](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli)
- [Running and debugging tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests)

### Handy Playwright flags

- `--headed` — run headed browsers
- `--debug` — open Playwright Inspector
- `--workers <n>` — configure parallelism
- `--trace <mode>` — `on`, `off`, `on-first-retry`, `on-all-retries`, `retain-on-failure`
- `--grep <regex>` — run only matching tests (matches project + file + describe + test title + tags)
- `--repeat-each <n>` — run each test `n` times (useful for checking stability)

### Filtering with `--grep` in shell and CI

When the pattern contains alternation (`|`), pass `--grep` with **single quotes**:

```shell
npx playwright test --project=Portal --grep='P-GEN-1.2\]|P-GEN-1.1\]|P-ODPPG-1\]'
```

In bash scripts (including GitHub Actions steps that `echo` CLI arguments into `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`), do not place `--grep="..."` inside an outer double-quoted string. The inner `"` closes the string early and bash treats `|` as a pipe (`command not found`, exit code 127) even when Playwright would run the tests correctly.
